# Flights

A quick project to analyse the best way to travel across
the globe. 

## Open Data

This repository exploits [OpenFlight data](http://openflights.org/data.html) 
as its only data source.

## Prerequisites

The project is built with `Scala`. All you need to compile and run 
the project is listed as follows:

- sbt, the [Scala Build Tool](http://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html)

The project itself is not specifically configured for any particular IDE, if
you like to use one you should install its appropriate sbt plugin globally
instead of adding it to every project you touch.

## Run

Simply run `sbt run` to compile and run the project.
The program reads the flights data into an `H2` database and you will see 
two available modes to run as follows.

![RUN SCREEN](/media/run.png)

Type either `a` or `b` following by ENTER to choose a function you want.

## a) Finding routes

Given a source and a destination city, the program traverse and 
expands all best applicable routes between the two cities. 
Routes with greater than 2 connections basically take up massive time 
to compute than fewer links.

## b) Spanning routes

>**Prerequisite:** To enable Google Map visualisation, an API key needs 
to be store in `html/js/gapi.js`. See the following example:

**html/js/gapi.js**

```javascript
function getAPIKey(){ return 'AIzaSyD*************'}
```

Given a list of multiple cities, the program creates a 
[Minimum Spanning Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_spanning_tree) 
which connects all cities together with minimal total distances.
